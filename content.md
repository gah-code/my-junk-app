### We are a local business that has been in the industry for years

We have a team of professionals, who are all fully trained and ready to tackle any job. We can remove any type of junk or waste from your property, including household appliances, construction debris, yard waste and more! We also offer furniture disposal services for those items that you no longer want in your home but can't seem to part with.

### Our goal is to provide every customer with the highest level

Our staff will arrive on time, work quickly and efficiently while maintaining a clean environment at all times. They will always be courteous and respectful towards you and your property while working so that you can feel comfortable leaving them alone on site without worry about damage or theft occurring during their visit.

### ECO- FRIENDLY

Not every junk item is meant to be thrown away, and we understand that.
Our team sorts your junk into three categories – Recycle, Donate, Dispose Of – and removes it accordingly.
